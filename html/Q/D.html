She was just 14 and the unintended victim of a gang dispute.  Her death was the impetus for the launch of the citys Gun Violence Crisis Management System (also known as CMS) the following year.  CMS concentrates its resources on 17 police precincts where 51% of shootings occur, citywide. Since 2014, nearly $20 million dollars has been provided to CMS and its Cure Violence partners. They are credited with reducing the rate of shootings in neighborhoods across the five boroughs.  In the South Jamaica area overseen by Cure Violence organization LIFE Camp Inc., more than 500 consecutive days have elapsed without a single shooting.  The lives saved can be attributed to the public outrage at the untimely death of DAja Naquai Robinson.
