Assisted by militant Irish socialists, the groups rioted and attacked British provincial government headquarters across Dublin and seized the Irish capitals General Post Office.  They proclaimed the independence of Ireland, which had been under the repressive thumb of the United Kingdom for centuries, and by the next morning were in control of much of the city.  Later that day, however, British authorities launched a counteroffensive, and by April 29 the uprising had ended.  The Easter Rebellion is considered a significant marker on the road to establishing an independent Irish republic. (Crowley)
