Born in Missouri, she was a house slave for a wealthy planter until his death.  During the Civil War she was freed by Union soldiers and soon went to work for the Army as a paid servant.   On November 15, 1866, she enlisted as a cook, using the name William Cathay.  An Army surgeon examined her, apparently not very thoroughly, and found her fit for duty.  She was assigned to the 38th Infantry, one of the Buffalo Soldier regiments. Traveling throughout the west with her unit took a toll on her  health.  She was hospitalized five times, yet it was never discovered that she was female.  In her two years in the Army she participated in regular garrison duties but there is no record that she ever saw direct combat.  She was seemingly not well regarded by her commanding officer, but when her sex was finally discovered, she was granted an honorable discharge.
